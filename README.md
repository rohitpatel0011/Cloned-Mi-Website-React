# Cloned-Mi-Website-React
A ReactJS project aimed at cloning the mi.com website, offering a responsive and interactive user interface that replicates the design and functionality of the original site. This project serves as a demonstration of my skills in web development and ReactJS, showcasing my ability to recreate complex website layouts and implement dynamic features.
